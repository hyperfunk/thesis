## A search for supersymmetry using the Î±T variable with the CMS detector \
and the impact of experimental searches for supersymmetry on supersymmetric \
parameter space

A search for supersymmetry in final states with jets and missing
transverse energy is performed in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass
energy of sqrt(s)=7TeV. The data sample corresponds to 4.98fb^-1 collected by
the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011.  A dimensionless kinematic variable is
used as the main discriminant between genuine and misreconstructed signal
events. The search is performed in a signal region binned according to the
scalar sum of the transverse energy of jets and the number of jets identified as
originating from a bottom quark.  The limits are presented in the parameter
space of the cMSSM as well as in simplified models with particular
attention paid to compressed spectra and third-generation models.

Global frequentist fits to the cMSSM and NUHM1 are also performed
using the Mastercode framework incorporating recent experimental
constraints, including those presented here.  Global likelihood contours
are presented in the parameter planes of both the cMSSM and NUHM1,
as well as a selection of 1D likelihood functions for observables.
