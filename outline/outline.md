# Thesis outline

### Sam Rogerson

## Introduction

- Standard LHC schpiel, prospects for BSM
- Brief: importance of SUSY, currently mostly unconstrained
- Need both experimental probing and interpretation


---

## Theory

- SM: Brief intro, predictive power (EWPOs), problems (H: w-scattering),
  hierarchy problem
- BSM: Motivate via problems with SM - i.e. what BSM needs to provide
- SUSY: Basic introduction to construction
- SUSY:
    * motivate R parity via proton
    * RP implies stable neutralino
    * Stable neutralino is CDM candidate
    * Motivate low mass neutralino
    * low mass neutralino implies MET
- Minimal SUSY:
    * MSSM introduction: how to we minimally get what we want from SUSY
      framework
- Models of SUSY: each gets rough theory treatment, and pheno: what
  differentiates it, why look for it, what is the "dead end" if any
    * Universal and 2 scale models: cMSSM, vcMSSM, mSUGRA
    * Non-universal models: NUHM{1,2}
    * pMSSM
    * OSET -> SMS

## Exploring SUSY models

- Making use of MET signatures: alphaT
    * description
    * QCD backgroud parameterization
    * Signal model examples
    * Likelihood model (b-jet multiplicities)
    * ... ( this seciton needs some discussion/input on areas to be covered )
- Results: presented in cMSSM and SMS with scaling (i.e. each of the three
  results so far)

## Constraining models of SUSY

- Standard constraints
    * Omega h^2


```python
def test()
    myObj.method(globals(),True,None,literal, f)
```

(@foo1) $$x^2_{lol} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial y}$$
(@foo2) $$x^2_{lol} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial y}$$


Im going to reference @foo1
