  \begin{abstract}

      A search for supersymmetry in final states with jets and missing
      transverse energy is performed in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy
      of $\sqrt{s}=7\TeV$. The data sample corresponds to $4.98\invfemtobarn$
      collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC.  A dimensionless kinematic
      variable is used as the main discriminant between genuine and
      misreconstructed signal events. The search is performed in a signal region
      binned according to the scalar sum of the transverse energy of jets and
      the number of jets identified as originating from a bottom quark.  The
      limits are presented in the parameter space of the \ac{cMSSM} as well as
      in simplified models with particular attention paid to compressed spectra
      and third-generation models.

      Global frequentist fits to the \ac{cMSSM} and NUHM1 are also performed
      using the \Mastercode framework incorporating recent experimental
      constraints, including those presented here.  Global likelihood contours
      are presented in the parameter planes of both the \ac{cMSSM} and NUHM1, as
      well as a selection of 1D likelihood functions for observables.
