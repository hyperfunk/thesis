    \maketitle
    \begin{abstract}

        A search for supersymmetry in final states with jets and missing
        transverse energy is performed in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass
        energy of $\sqrt{s}=7\TeV$. The data sample corresponds to
        $4.98\invfemtobarn$ collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in 2011.
        A dimensionless kinematic variable is used as the main discriminant
        between genuine and misreconstructed signal events. The search is
        performed in a signal region binned according to the scalar sum of the
        transverse energy of jets and the number of jets identified as
        originating from a bottom quark.  The limits are presented in the
        parameter space of the \ac{cMSSM} as well as in simplified models with
        particular attention paid to compressed spectra and third-generation
        models.

        Global frequentist fits to the \ac{cMSSM} and NUHM1 are also performed
        using the \Mastercode framework incorporating recent experimental
        constraints, including those presented here.  Global likelihood contours
        are presented in the parameter planes of both the \ac{cMSSM} and NUHM1,
        as well as a selection of 1D likelihood functions for observables.
